Blackjack, the notorious game found in every casino worldwide, is a game of logic, strategy, reasoning, and of course, luck. There are numerous factors that go into making blackjack the game it is, so I decided to tackle it myself, creating a fully functioning version of it, with numerous goals in mind to make it is as close to the real thing as possible.
Here are my goals for the project:

Version 1.0: Have a fully working console application with the core blackjack mechanics, following solid OOP principles and ensure the project is as clean and easy to understand as possible. Ideally done before Sept 1st, 2025.
Version 2.0: Convert standard java code into Java Springboot Rest API, allowing for requests to be made to API for game to be played. Ideally done before Dec 31st, 2025.
Version 3.0: Create a frontend for the application with a javascript framework (Angular, React, Vue, etc.), connecting the Rest API and allowing the game to be played in browsers. Ideally done by April 1st, 2025.

Future plans: Potentially host game on web server, allowing others to use it. 

The entire goal of this project is to make a fully functioning full-stack application, learning some new technologies in the process. The due dates are heavily lenient due to personal commitments, but I will try to make at least one commit 3-5 times per week in order to progress. I believe one large finished application is better then numerous small ones, hence the big goals.
