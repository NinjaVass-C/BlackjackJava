# Blackjack Game

Blackjack, the notorious game found in casinos worldwide, is a game of **logic, strategy, reasoning, and luck**. This project aims to replicate the experience of a real casino blackjack game as closely as possible. Includes a java console blackjack version as well as an api with frontend implementation.

> **Note:** This project is currently in a working state but is being put aside for now. While functional, there are potential improvements to enhance gameplay, and I plan to focus on a new flagship project.
