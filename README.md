Blackjack, the notorious game found in every casino worldwide, is a game of logic, strategy, reasoning, and of course, luck. There are numerous factors that go into making blackjack the game it is, so I decided to tackle it myself, creating a fully functioning version of it, with numerous goals in mind to make it is as close to the real thing as possible.
Here are my goals for the project:
1. Create a fully functioning game of blackjack, with chips, a deck that keeps track of used cards and shuffles after a certain point, as well as multi deck, making card counting viable.
2. Allow for multiple hands to be played at once, increasing the dynamic of the "real table" of blackjack.
3. Track the count of the cards, allowing players to view it if wanted.
4. Create an api that tracks basic strategy, so if a user wants, can be given the "correct play"
5. Side bets that most casinos have, including insurance, perfect pair, etc.
6. Develop a front end using Java Swing, or another front end framework.
